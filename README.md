# LimeBike Challenge

## How to Run 

This program is written in Ruby. If you have ruby installed, `cd` into this directory and type `ruby limebike.rb`. You should see output in the console. 

## Solving the challenge

I used the sample data provided and ran from there. This program uses O(n^2 - 1) complexity. I realized that the first imput was set in stone, so you subtract one for that. I'm sure there's a more efficient way of solving this problem, but I'm not as well-versed in making algorithms as I am in general iOS programming.
